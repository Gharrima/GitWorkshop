.git Workshop
================

Overview
------------
Two silly projects directories exist.  
Each one can be used to mock a real world .git workflow. 

Each folder contains a TODO.md file with tasks to complete. 

1. Complete one of those tasks on a feature branch, in the format: feature123, branching off master
2. Code
3. Update Master
4. Update your branch with updates from Master
5. Put your changes back onto Master
6. Share your chnages with the remote repository. 


Done!
